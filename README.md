# Plant Seedling Classification
A CNN model to classify 12 categories of seedlings through their image

The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, released a dataset containing images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages.
Kaggle has the complete dataset used for a competition here:

This project was created as a learning experience after 2 years of competition on tensorflow.
It achieved an accuracy of 94% on the competition, here a link to the notebook:

A saved Model that can be easily used with tensorflow has been included in the "Model" directory.


I am also including a py script you can directly use to classify images as "run.py".




Thank you for your time.
